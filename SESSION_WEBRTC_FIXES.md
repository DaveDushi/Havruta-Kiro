# Session Scheduling & WebRTC Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Session Scheduling
**Problem**: Frontend couldn't schedule sessions - missing scheduling service and UI components.

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Created `frontend/src/services/schedulingService.ts` - Complete API client for scheduling
- ✅ Created `frontend/src/components/SessionSchedulingDialog.tsx` - Full scheduling UI with recurring options
- ✅ Updated `frontend/src/hooks/useDashboardData.ts` - Integrated proper scheduling service
- ✅ Updated `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` - Added scheduling dialog and buttons
- ✅ Added WebRTC testing utilities in `frontend/src/utils/webrtcTest.ts`

### 2. WebRTC Issues
**Problem**: WebRTC functionality exists but may have connectivity/socket issues.

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Verified WebRTC service implementation is correct
- ✅ Verified socket service has proper WebRTC event handling
- ✅ Verified backend WebSocket handlers for WebRTC signaling
- ✅ Added WebRTC diagnostic tools for troubleshooting
- ✅ Fixed notification service error handling in scheduling

## New Features Added

### Session Scheduling Dialog
- Single and recurring session scheduling
- Support for daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly patterns
- Day-of-week selection for weekly patterns
- End date configuration
- Participant management
- Form validation

### WebRTC Diagnostics
- Browser WebRTC support detection
- Camera/microphone access testing
- STUN server connectivity testing
- Comprehensive test suite with detailed results

## How to Test

### 1. Session Scheduling
1. Start the backend server: `cd backend && npm run dev`
2. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Login to the dashboard
4. Click "Schedule" button on any Havruta card
5. Configure session details:
   - Set start time (must be in future)
   - Toggle recurring if needed
   - Select frequency and days for recurring
   - Set optional end date
6. Click "Schedule Session"
7. Check that success message appears
8. Verify session appears in "Next Up" section

### 2. WebRTC Testing
1. On the dashboard, click "Test WebRTC" button (in test mode)
2. Review test results:
   - ✅ Support: Browser compatibility
   - ✅ Media: Camera/microphone access
   - ✅ STUN: Network connectivity
3. If any tests fail, check browser permissions and network

### 3. Video Call Testing
1. Create or join a Havruta
2. Click "Join Collaborative" 
3. Navigate to TextViewer with collaborative mode
4. Video call component should appear in top-right
5. Test video/audio controls
6. Open another browser/tab and join same session
7. Verify peer-to-peer connection

## API Endpoints Available

### Scheduling
- `POST /api/scheduling/sessions` - Schedule new session
- `GET /api/scheduling/sessions/upcoming` - Get upcoming sessions
- `PUT /api/scheduling/sessions/:id` - Reschedule session
- `DELETE /api/scheduling/sessions/:id` - Cancel session
- `GET /api/scheduling/patterns/:id` - Get recurrence pattern
- `PUT /api/scheduling/patterns/:id` - Update recurrence pattern
- `DELETE /api/scheduling/patterns/:id` - Delete recurrence pattern

### Session Management
- `POST /api/sessions` - Initialize session
- `GET /api/sessions/active` - Get active sessions
- `POST /api/sessions/:id/join` - Join session
- `POST /api/sessions/:id/leave` - Leave session
- `POST /api/sessions/:id/end` - End session

## Troubleshooting

### Session Scheduling Issues
- **"Validation error"**: Check that start time is in future and required fields are filled
- **"Failed to schedule"**: Verify backend is running and user is authenticated
- **No sessions in "Next Up"**: Check that sessions were created and are in the future

### WebRTC Issues
- **"Camera/microphone access denied"**: Grant browser permissions
- **"STUN connectivity failed"**: Check network/firewall settings
- **No video in call**: Verify camera permissions and WebRTC support
- **Can't connect to peer**: Check that both users are in same session

### Backend Issues
- **Scheduling routes not found**: Verify backend includes scheduling routes in server.ts
- **Database errors**: Run `npm run db:push` to update schema
- **Socket connection failed**: Check WebSocket server is running

## Next Steps

1. **Add date picker library**: Install `@mui/x-date-pickers` for better UX
2. **Add push notifications**: Implement browser notifications for session reminders
3. **Add session history**: Show past sessions in dashboard
4. **Add session recordings**: Store session content and progress
5. **Add mobile support**: Optimize video calls for mobile devices

## Files Modified/Created

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/services/schedulingService.ts` (NEW)
